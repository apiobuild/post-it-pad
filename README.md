# Post-it-Pad

Post-it Pad contains generic html email layouts. It's integrated and intended to be used with [Post-it by apio](https://telescope.apiobuild.com/app/post-it). However, the generated html can also be used anywhere.

It comes with cmd interface and can be imported to other go projects. The API supports the following basic functionality:

1. Create new blank layout for customization
2. Generate HTML with example args for specific or all layouts
3. Generate HTML with custom args

We welcome contributions for more layouts as the community sees fit.
